## Executive Summary

**Business Result:** Developed and validated an ensemble machine learning model that predicts booking cancellations with **87.5% accuracy** and **86% sensitivity**, demonstrating a scalable solution to address the $670K annual revenue loss from cancellations in mid-sized hotels. This portfolio project showcases a production-ready approach to proactive revenue protection through data-driven risk assessment.

## Dataset Context

**Origin and Source**
This analysis utilizes the publicly available Hotel Booking Demand dataset from two hotels in Portugal, providing real-world validation of the methodology:

- **H1**: A resort hotel in the Algarve region (southern Portugal, tourism-focused)
- **H2**: A city hotel in Lisbon (urban business/leisure mix)
- **Period**: Bookings scheduled between July 2015 - August 2017 (119,000+ observations)
- **Data Integrity**: Personally identifiable information removed for privacy; all data anonymized for research use

*Source: Hotel booking demand datasets [ResearchGate Publication](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329286343_Hotel_booking_demand_datasets)*

**Note**: While this specific implementation uses historical Portuguese hotel data, the methodology, feature engineering, and model architecture are directly applicable to hotel operations globally, particularly addressing the universal challenge of cancellation-driven revenue loss.

> [!TIP]
> You can adapt this dataset structure for other domains, such as airline reservations or event bookings, using the same feature engineering techniques.


## Business Context: The Impact of Cancellations

In a typical urban hotel generating **$10M in annual revenue**, cancellations and no-shows result in **6.7% revenue loss ($670K annually)**, with peaks of **11% during high-demand seasons**.

### Key Factors
- **Distribution Channels:** OTAs (e.g., Booking.com) contribute up to **40% of cancellation-driven losses**.  
- **Guest Segments:** Gen Z and Millennials exhibit **64‚Äì66% flexibility preference**, often rebooking at lower prices.  
- **Pricing Sensitivity:** A **$50 rate increase** raises cancellation probability by **16%**.

> [!NOTE]
> On average, cancellations and no-shows can erode more than **6% of annual revenue** in mid-sized hotels ‚Äî a margin often greater than yearly operational cost reductions.

### Model Selection Rationale

The **Voting Classifier with Under-Sampling** was selected for its optimal trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity.  
It minimizes missed cancellations (false negatives) that represent the highest financial risk.

> [!TIP]
> The chosen ensemble model prioritizes **sensitivity** (detecting cancellations) over **overall accuracy**, reflecting a business-driven decision: missing a cancellation is costlier than flagging a false one.

**Advantages:**
- Improved detection of high-risk bookings  
- Ensemble robustness from multiple model perspectives  
- Balanced performance (specificity 88%, sensitivity 86%)

## Model Evaluation Metrics

The following business-critical metrics were prioritized:

- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Ability to detect actual cancellations, enabling proactive retention.
- **Precision**: Accuracy in flagging potential cancellations to optimize retention campaign costs.
- **Specificity**: Success in identifying loyal customers to maintain positive relationships.
- **False Positive Rate**: Control measure for minimizing unnecessary retention actions.

### Sampling Strategies & Model Performance

#### Under-Sampling Approach
Balanced dataset by reducing majority class (non-cancellations) to match minority class size.

**Models Evaluated:**
- Random Forest (Accuracy: 87%, Sensitivity: 86%)
- XGBoost (Accuracy: 85%, Sensitivity: 84%)
- CatBoost (Accuracy: 86%, Sensitivity: 85%)
- **Voting Classifier** üèÜ (Accuracy: 87.5%, Sensitivity: 86%)
  - Ensemble weights: RF(2.5), CatBoost(1.5), XGB(1.0)

#### Over-Sampling Approach (SVM-SMOTE)
Enhanced minority class representation through synthetic sample generation.

**Models Evaluated:**
- Random Forest (Accuracy: 88%, Sensitivity: 84%)
- XGBoost (Accuracy: 87%, Sensitivity: 83%)
- CatBoost (Accuracy: 88%, Sensitivity: 84%)
- **Voting Classifier** üèÜ (Accuracy: 88.2%, Sensitivity: 84%)
  - Ensemble weights: RF(2.5), XGB(1.0), CatBoost(1.0)

### Strategic Model Selection

After comprehensive evaluation, the **Over-Sampling (SVM-SMOTE) Voting Classifier** was selected as the optimal solution for deployment.

**Key Advantages:**
1. **Superior Cost-Effectiveness**
   - Higher precision in cancellation predictions (80%)
   - Optimized retention budget allocation
   - Reduced false-positive costs

2. **Enhanced Customer Experience**
   - Lower false alarm rate (10.2% vs 12.7%)
   - Preserved customer goodwill
   - More targeted retention actions

3. **Balanced Performance**
   - Strong overall accuracy (88.2%)
   - Robust sensitivity (84%)
   - Excellent specificity (89.8%)

While the under-sampling approach showed marginally higher sensitivity (86%), the over-sampling model's superior precision and reduced false positives make it more suitable for practical business implementation, balancing operational costs with customer relationship management.

### Business Impact

The selected model enables:
- Proactive identification of 84% of potential cancellations
- 89.8% accuracy in identifying loyal customers
- Only 10.2% false alarm rate, minimizing unnecessary retention costs
- Data-driven retention strategies with 83% precision

This solution provides a scalable framework for hotels to protect revenue through early cancellation detection while maintaining positive customer relationships through precise intervention targeting.
