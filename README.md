## Executive Summary

**Business Impact:** Developed and deployed an ensemble machine learning model predicting booking cancellations with **88.2% accuracy** and **84% sensitivity**, directly addressing the **$670K annual revenue loss** from cancellations in mid-sized hotels.

**Key Achievement:** Balanced precision (83%) and sensitivity (84%) to optimize retention campaign efficiency while minimizing false alarms that damage customer relationships.

**Solution:** Production-ready interactive Streamlit web application enabling real-time cancellation risk assessment for individual bookings.

## Business Problem

### The Challenge

In a typical urban hotel generating **$10M in annual revenue**, cancellations and no-shows result in **6.7% revenue loss ($670K annually)**, with peaks of **11% during high-demand seasons**.

### Key Business Drivers

| Factor | Impact | Insight |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Distribution Channels** | 40% of losses | OTAs (e.g., Booking.com) drive highest cancellations |
| **Guest Segments** | 64-66% flexibility | Gen Z & Millennials rebook at lower prices |
| **Pricing Sensitivity** | +16% risk | Each $50 rate increase raises cancellation probability |

## Solution Overview

### 🏆 Optimal Model: Voting Classifier with Over-Sampling (SVM-SMOTE)

| Metric | Score | Business Impact |
|--------|-------|-----------------|
| **Accuracy** | 88.2% | Correct predictions overall |
| **Sensitivity (Recall)** | 84% | Detects 84% of actual cancellations |
| **Precision** | 83% | When flagged, 83% truly cancel |
| **Specificity** | 89.8% | Identifies 89.8% of loyal customers |
| **F1-Score** | 0.83 | Balanced performance |
| **False Positive Rate** | 10.2% | Only 10.2% loyal customers falsely flagged |

### Why This Model?

**Cost-Effectiveness**
- 83% precision = efficient retention budget allocation
- 10.2% FPR minimizes unnecessary retention offers
- Better ROI on campaigns

**Customer Experience**
- Low false alarm rate protects goodwill
- Avoids frustrating loyal customers
- Maintains brand reputation

**Balanced Performance**
- 84% sensitivity catches real cancellations
- 89.8% specificity identifies loyal guests
- Strategic advantage over short-term catch rates

---

## Technical Approach

### Feature Engineering

**Dimensionality Reduction (PCA):**
- Combined `no_of_adults` + `no_of_children` → `no_of_people` (1 component)
- Combined `no_of_weekend_nights` + `no_of_week_nights` → `no_of_week_days` (1 component)
- Reduces multicollinearity while preserving variance

**Feature Selection:**
- **Kept:** `lead_time`, `avg_price_per_room`, `no_of_special_requests`, `market_segment_type`, `type_of_meal_plan`
- **Removed:** `arrival_date`, `arrival_year`, `room_type_reserved`, `repeated_guest`, `required_car_parking_space` (low predictive power)

**Business-Informed Encoding:**
- Monthly cancellation rates → binary high-risk/low-risk categorization
- Historical cancellation rates from previous bookings

### Preprocessing Pipeline

```python
ColumnTransformer:
├── RobustScaler (numerical features - outlier-resistant)
├── PCA (correlated feature pairs)
└── OneHotEncoder (categorical variables)
```

**Why RobustScaler?** Handles outliers better than StandardScaler for tree-based models.

### Ensemble Architecture

**Voting Classifier (Soft Voting - Probability-Based)**

```
Random Forest (weight: 2.5)
    ↘
      → Voting Classifier
    ↗
CatBoost (weight: 1.5)

XGBoost (weight: 1.0)
```

**Model Rationale:**
- Combines tree-based, gradient-boosting, and categorical specialists
- Soft voting leverages probability predictions
- Weighted configuration prioritizes Random Forest stability

## Model Performance

### Model Comparison: Under-Sampling vs. Over-Sampling (SVMSMOTE)

#### Under-Sampling Results

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Specificity |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Random Forest | 87% | 0.80 | 0.86 | 0.83 | 88% |
| XGBoost | 85% | 0.78 | 0.84 | 0.81 | 86% |
| CatBoost | 86% | 0.79 | 0.85 | 0.82 | 87% |
| **Voting Classifier** | **87.5%** | **0.81** | **0.86** | **0.83** | **87.3%** |

**Pros:** Highest recall (catches more cancellations)  
**Cons:** 12.7% false positive rate (loyalty impact)

#### Over-Sampling (SVMSMOTE) Results ✅ Selected

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Specificity |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Random Forest | 88% | 0.82 | 0.84 | 0.83 | 90% |
| XGBoost | 87% | 0.80 | 0.83 | 0.82 | 89% |
| CatBoost | 88% | 0.82 | 0.84 | 0.83 | 90% |
| **Voting Classifier** | **88.2%** | **0.83** | **0.84** | **0.83** | **89.8%** |

**Pros:** Better precision, lower FPR (10.2%), balanced metrics  
**Cons:** Slightly longer training time

### Why Over-Sampling Was Selected

1. **Better precision** → Efficient budget allocation
2. **Lower FPR** → Better customer relationships
3. **Long-term value** > short-term recall gain
